# Petful

This is Petful, an online pet adoption app that utilizes data structure techniques in order to create a unique pet adoption experience. Two pets are available for adoption at any given time. Once a pet is adopted, the next cat or dog in line becomes available. Add your name to the list to adopt the next available pet!
